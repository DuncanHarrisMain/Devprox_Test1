# Devprox_Test1
By Duncan Harris
________________________________________________________________________________________
Description
To accomplish the requirements of Test 1 I made use of PHP, HTML, CSS and MySql.
All validation and database connections are handled through PHP.
I used Xampp to establish an apache connection and made use of MySql workbench to develop the schema.
The username and password for database connection have been set to root and password.
The PHP provides error messages for all validation and does not allow for id number duplication.
The functionality of the cancel button is minimal.
